        <p>Hawaii shrimp trucks are famous for garlic shrimp. Itâ€™s easy to make and super garlicky. Squeeze lemon all
            over and serve with rice (which soaks up the garlic butter sauce)</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1lb large shrimp, deveined</li>
        <li>1 stick butter</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>1 head garlic</li>
        <li>3/4 cup flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cayenne</li>
        <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the flour, paprika, cayene, salt, and black pepper in a dish. Coat the shrimp with the flour mixture.
            Make sure all the shrimp is coated evenly. Set the shrimp aside.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter and one tablespoon of olive oil on medium heat in a large pan. Once the butter has melted,
            add the
            chopped garlic to the melted butter & oil, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until you see the garlic has turned
            light brown.
            TAKE CARE TO NOT BURN THE GARLIC!</li>
        <li>Remove the garlic sauce from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the second tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Once heated, add your shrimp to the pan.</li>
        <li>Cook the shrimp over medium high heat for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. You may need to cook the shrimp in
            batches to
            avoid overcrowding the pan.</li>
        <li>Once you have cooked the last batch of shrimp, add all the shrimp back to the pan and pour over the garlic
            sauce. Stir
            to combine and garnish with parsley.</li>
        <li>Serve Hawaiian Style with sticky white rice</li>
    </ol>
